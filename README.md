# TechMedicos

This project provides us with a backend and a front end for a Hospital Management System. Implementors have the freedom to build the control layer as per their requirement. 

The primary functions available are outlined in the interface provided by the service layer. A sample implementation of the available functions are provided in the application.java file. 

The frontend is located in /application/frontend/ directory and the backend is provided within the /application/techmedicos/ directory.

The Backend is created as per layered architecture guidelines. It consists of a seperate layer for Database Connection, Data access (repository layer) Services.

The Frontend consists of HTML and CSS for the template and Javascript for validation and interactivity.

Basic documentation regarding the Database, Dataflow, and testing can be found in the /documents/ directory.
